# Applied-Machine-Learning

These were some of my mini ML projects done as part of my coursework at Cornell Tech

1) Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster 
* Implemented logistic regression to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster with the model.
* Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic
* Link to my code: https://github.com/aashiperun/Applied-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Kaggle_Titanic_Disaster.ipynb

2) Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets'
* Performed a model comparison between Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.
* Link to dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started
* Link to my code: https://github.com/aashiperun/Applied-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Kaggle_NLP_Disaster_Tweets.ipynb

3) Eigenface for Face Recognition
* Implemented the Eigenface method for recognizing human faces.
* Dataset: Yale Dataset B
* Link to my code: https://github.com/aashiperun/Applied-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Eigen%20Face%20for%20Face%20Recognition.ipynb

4) Predicting Restaurant Closures in NYC
* Analyzed the NYC Restaurant Inspection dataset to predict closures using two models, logistic regression and random forest.
* Dataset: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j
* Link to my code: https://github.com/aashiperun/Applied-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Predicting_Restaurant_Closures_nyc.ipynb
